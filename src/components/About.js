           <p>In 1938, the 923-acre property located between the base of Mt. Joseph and Wallowa Lake in Oregon was built as a guest ranch. Multiple log cabins have come and gone over the years but the Main house and 5 other cabins remain original.
The Buhler family purchased “The Mt. Joseph Ranch” in 1957. Since then The Ranch has been enjoyed by several generations of family and friends. <br />  A small herd of registered Gelbvieh cattle have roamed the ranch exclusively since 1986. 
The cattle have provided for many generations of our family and we feel that new lodging options and hemp farming will do the same for the next generations.
In addition to the new lodging options, hemp farming, and the cattle operation the Mt. Joseph Ranch also provides a venue for weddings, parties, celebrations, art projects, and other projects to enrich the property and community. <br /> Other Ranch events include the week-long Chief Joseph Kids Summer Camp held annually in July. Our family has been hosting this camp for over 50 years!
The Ranch participates in organic farming, sustainable forestry projects, Aspen grove restoration, and rotational grazing practices in an effort to preserve the integrity of the Mt. Joseph Ranch and its land.</p>
